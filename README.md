# Usage

* Dump all your raw transcript files into the `raw/` directory
    * **[NOTE]** This script will format _everything_ in `raw/`, so delete older transcript files from that directory if you don't need them anymore!
* Run `parse.sh`
* `parse.sh` will generate a new file (`transcript.txt`) containing all the wiki-formatted transcripts
